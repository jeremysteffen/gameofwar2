//Coding Steps:
//For the final project you will be creating an automated version 
//of the classic card game WAR.
//Think about how you would build this project and 
//write your plan down. Consider classes such 
//as Card, Deck, and Player and what fields 
//and methods they might each have. 
//You can implement the game however youâ€™d like 
//(i.e. printing to the console, using alert, or some other way). 
//The completed project should, when ran, do the following:
//-	Deal 26 Cards to two Players from a Deck. 
//-	Iterate through the turns where each Player plays a Card
//-	The Player who played the higher card is awarded a point
//o	Ties result in zero points for either Player
//-	After all cards have been played, display the score.
//Write Unit Tests using Mocha and Chai for each 
//of the functions you write.

//test Player and Deck / create a Deck and check to make sure it has cards / create a Player
